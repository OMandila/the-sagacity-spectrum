                  <p>
                    FSC needed to modernize its data architecture to enhance
                    data utilization in risk management, monitoring &
                    evaluation, marketing, communication, and innovation,
                    focusing on efficient data collection, processing, storage,
                    retrieval, cataloging, classification, and enabling
                    self-service analytics and visualization.
                  </p>
                  <hr />
                  <p>I led the recruitment of new data and GIS experts into the FSC data team. I managed strategic collaborations with:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><em>ISEAL Data Community of Practice</em> to leverage the ISEAL Data Maturity Rubric.</li>

                    <li><em>Microsoft</em> to leverage the Intelligent Data Platform implementation framework.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <hr />
                  <p>Under my leadership, the FSC data team worked on the following data & analytics initiatives:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><em>The FSC Data & Innovations Program Charter:- </em>
                      A program leadership and business continuity document describing the scope, governance 
                      and objectives of the program in relation to business needs and desired strategic benefits.</li>
                    <li><em>The FSC-Esri Enterprise Agreement:- </em>
                      A business case containing cost-benefits analysis for the FSC leadership team to consider a strategic partnership with Esri
                      in order to access and deploy Esri's cutting-edge geolocation data management software technologies like the ArcGIS Suite.</li>
                    <li><em>The FSC Check:- </em>
                    A new platform for FSC to conduct due diligence checks on new certification clients.</li>
                    <li><em>Shared Value from FSC Certified Plantation forests: South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia Pilot:- </em>
                    A Mobile Data Collection & Analytics tool for FSC certified forest managers who want to quantify the shared value of their forests in their ecosystem.</li>
                    <li><em>StoryMaps based strategic communications tool:- </em>
                    The media and communications team working with the data team created interactive and immersive stories based on ArcGIS StoryMaps technology to showcase the value of FSC Certification.</li>
                    <li><em>The FSC Forest Atlas:- </em>
                      A GIS platform meant to collect, visualize and manage forest boundary data from all FSC Certified Forests globally.</li>

                    by forest managers worldwide.
